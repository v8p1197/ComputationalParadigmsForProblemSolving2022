# ComputationalParadigmsForProblemSolving2022

This repository contains the code as the assignment for the final assessment of the course "Computational Paradigms for Problem Solving", as part of the Ph.D. programme in Information Engineering at University of Salerno.

It consists in developing scripts and functions in ProLog (as part of the Logic Programming paradigm) and Scheme (as part of the Functional Programming paradigm).

The scripts in ProLog are documented in the [ProLog](./ProLog/) directory.

The functions in Scheme are documented in the [Scheme](./Scheme/) directory.
